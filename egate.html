<h1 id="biotech">Biotechnology</h1>
<h2> Etymology and Origins</h2>
<p>
    The term biotechnology is a fusion of two Greek-derived words: bios meaning "life" and technologia meaning "systematic treatment of an art or craft". The word first appeared in 1947 to describe the use of machinery in relation to human needs, and by 1964, it evolved to refer specifically to the use of biological processes in industrial production1. This linguistic evolution mirrors the field’s transformation—from a general concept to a specialized scientific discipline.
<h2>Early Applications and Agricultural Roots </h2>
<p>
    Biotechnology has ancient roots in agriculture and food production. Early humans unknowingly practiced biotechnology when fermenting beer, baking bread with yeast, or selectively breeding crops and animals for desirable traits. These rudimentary techniques laid the groundwork for what would later become genetic manipulation and molecular biology. The discovery of DNA’s structure in 1953 marked a turning point, enabling scientists to understand and eventually alter genetic material.
<h2>  The Rise of Genetic Engineering </h2> 
<p>
    The 1970s ushered in the modern era of biotechnology with the development of recombinant DNA technology.
     This allowed genes from one organism to be inserted into another, paving the way for genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The first genetically engineered insulin was produced in 1982, revolutionizing diabetes treatment and proving biotech’s potential in medicine. Since then, biotech has expanded into pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and environmental science.
<h2>Branches and Specializations  </h2>
<p>
    Biotechnology is now a vast field with multiple branches. Red biotechnology focuses on medical applications like gene therapy and vaccine development.
     Green biotechnology enhances agricultural productivity through GMOs and pest-resistant crops. 
     White biotechnology applies biological processes to industrial production, such as biofuels and biodegradable plastics. 
     There’s also blue biotechnology for marine applications and gray biotechnology for environmental cleanup and sustainability.
<h2>Current Technological Landscape  </h2>
<p>
    Today’s biotech industry is powered by advanced tools like CRISPR-Cas9 for precise gene editing, synthetic biology for designing new biological systems, and AI-driven bioinformatics for analyzing massive datasets.
     Biotech companies are developing personalized medicine, lab-grown meat, and even biosensors that detect diseases in real time. The convergence of biology with digital technology is accelerating innovation at an unprecedented pace.
<h2>Future Horizons and  major leap in the 20th century.</h2>
    Ethiopia has also produced notable scientists who have contributed to global biotech. Gebisa Ejeta, a renowned agricultural researcher, developed drought-resistant sorghum hybrids that transformed food security across Africa. 
    His work earned him the World Food Prize and highlighted Ethiopia’s potential in biotech innovation. Another standout is Kitaw Ejigu, an aerospace engineer whose contributions to satellite systems and space technology reflect the broader scientific excellence emerging from Ethiopia.
<h2>The Future of Biotechnology</h2>
<p>
    Today, biotechnology is entering a new era with tools like CRISPR-Cas9 for gene editing, AI-driven drug discovery, and lab-grown meat. Ethiopia is expanding its biotech infrastructure, but challenges remain—such as limited funding, infrastructure gaps, and the need for skilled personnel. Globally, biotech continues to push boundaries, from curing genetic diseases to creating sustainable food systems.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Biotechnology’s history is a story of human ingenuity—from ancient crop cultivation in Ethiopia to gene therapies in global labs. While Ethiopia’s biotech sector is still growing, its unique contributions and scientific talent offer hope for a future where local innovation meets global impact. As the world faces challenges in health, food, and climate, biotechnology stands as a powerful tool for transformation.

<h1 id="stem">STEM: The Engine of Innovation</h1>
<p>STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, and it’s more than just an acronym—it’s a philosophy of learning and problem-solving. STEM education emphasizes inquiry, experimentation, and real-world application. Instead of memorizing facts, students are encouraged to ask questions, build models, test hypotheses, and iterate. For example:
Science teaches how the natural world works—from biology to physics.
Technology introduces digital tools, coding, and systems thinking.
Engineering focuses on designing solutions, building structures, and optimizing systems.
Mathematics provides the language of logic, patterns, and precision.
STEM is inherently interdisciplinary. A student building a weather station might use physics to understand sensors, coding to log data, and math to analyze trends. This kind of learning fosters creativity, resilience, and critical thinking—skills essential for the 21st century.
<h1>Robotics: The Fusion of Mechanics and Intelligence</h1>
 <p>Robotics is the art and science of designing machines that can sense, think, and act. It’s a perfect embodiment of STEM, combining mechanical engineering (structure and movement), electronics (sensors and actuators), and computer science (control and decision-making). Robots range from simple line-following bots to complex autonomous drones and humanoid assistants.
    In education, robotics is a powerful tool for hands-on learning. Students build robots using kits like LEGO Mindstorms or Arduino, program them to perform tasks, and troubleshoot issues in real time. This process teaches not just technical skills, but also teamwork, perseverance, and systems thinking. In industry, robotics is revolutionizing manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, and space exploration—automating tasks, improving precision, and expanding human capabilities.
    <p>Electronics: The Nervous System of Technology
    Electronics deals with the flow and control of electric current through circuits, components, and systems. It’s the backbone of modern devices—from smartphones and computers to medical equipment and satellites. Key concepts include:
    Voltage, current, and resistance—the building blocks of circuit theory.
    Components like resistors, capacitors, transistors, and microcontrollers.
    Digital electronics, which use binary logic to process information.
    In robotics, electronics are what allow machines to sense their environment (via sensors), move (via motors and actuators), and make decisions (via microcontrollers like Arduino or Raspberry Pi). Learning electronics empowers students to understand how devices work, build their own gadgets, and even prototype inventions. 
    It’s a gateway to fields like embedded systems, IoT, and hardware engineering.</p>
    <h2>STEM, Robotics & Electronics(summery)</h2>
    <p>STEM—short for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics—is the backbone of modern innovation. It nurtures analytical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity, forming the foundation for disciplines like robotics and electronics. Robotics blends mechanical engineering, electrical systems, and computer science to create intelligent machines capable of performing tasks autonomously. These systems are increasingly used in manufacturing, healthcare, and even disaster response. Electronics, meanwhile, powers everything from smartphones to satellites, relying on circuits, semiconductors, and microcontrollers to process and transmit information. Together, robotics and electronics exemplify how STEM education equips learners to build and understand the technologies shaping our world.

    <h3>General deffinition of HTML</h3>
    </header>
         HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web.
         It provides the structure for web pages by using a system of tags and elements that define the content and layout of a webpage.
 <h4>Key Features of HTML:</h4>
 
<li>Markup Language: HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that uses tags to annotate text, images, and other content for display in web browsers.
<li>Elements and Tags: HTML documents are made up of elements, which are defined by tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and most elements have an opening tag and a closing tag. For example, <p> is a tag that defines a paragraph, and </p> is the closing tag.
<li>Structure: HTML provides a way to structure content hierarchically. It allows developers to create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables, forms, and more.
<li>Hyperlinks: HTML enables the creation of hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between different web pages and resources on the internet.
<li>Compatibility: HTML is supported by all web browsers, making it a universal standard for web development.
<li>Semantic HTML: HTML5 introduced semantic elements that provide meaning to the content, such as &lt;header>, &lt;footer>, &lt;article>, and &lt;section>, improving accessibility and SEO.
Example of an HTML Document:
html
<pre>
  <code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
    &lt;html>
    &lt;head>
        &lt;title>My First Web Page&lt;/title>
    &lt;/head>
    &lt;body>
        &lt;h1>Welcome to My Web Page&lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>This is a paragraph of text on my web page.&lt;/p>
        a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example&lt;/a>
    &lt;/body>
    &lt;/html>
  </code>
</pre>
In this example, the HTML document defines a simple web page with a title, a heading, a paragraph, and a hyperlink.
<h5>Summary:</h5>
HTML is the foundational language for creating web pages, providing the structure and layout for content displayed in web browsers. It is essential for web development and is often used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing websites.<ul>
            <li>Markup: Text that has a special meaning
            <li>markup, tells the browser that the text should look like or how it is arrenged with in it
            <li>markup: text that gives <em>difference</em> on the code written and on one that is <em>displayed</em> on the browser.
        </ul>
    <section>
    <h3 class="a">Some elements with there deffenition and function</h3>
    <p>
        Every element starts and ends with a tag.<em>Hi there!</em>
        The first tag em is called an opening tag, the one with a slash /em is called a closing tag.
        HTML tags always start with the less than sign and end with a > tag. These are usually referred to as angle brackets.
        Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and line breaks. When the browser displays an HTML file, it treats a run of whitespace as a single space character.
        In order to create a line break that will show up in the browser, use the break tag.
    <P>
        You can create vertical space between pieces of text by inserting line breaks with br tags, or by putting the text in paragraphs with p tags.
        Note that if you were to use break to do this, you have to use two of them, as in double brake to get a line of space in between each line of text.
        (Using would probably be a better choice.)
    <P>
        The <strong>div</strong> is short for division, because that's what this element is for—you can use it to divide up the page into different sections.
        Like the paragraph p element, the division div element has an invisible box around it—and just like p, it can have a border, a margin, a width, a height, and so on.
        But a p element is specifically meant to contain text. In contrast, the div element is a generic container for whatever other elements you might want to put inside.
        You can use the div element to organize the content and divide the page into sections.
        It's used to divide up the page. The name div is short for division, because that's what this element is for—you can use it to divide up the page into different sections.
        It has an "invisible box" around it. Like the paragraph p element, the division div element has an invisible box around it—and just like p, it can have a border, a margin, a width, a height, and so on.
        It is a generic container. A p element is specifically meant to contain text. In contrast, the div element is a generic container, meaning you can put whatever other elements you want inside. 
        You can use the div element to organize the content and divide the page into sections.
    <p>
        <mark>Note:</mark> Pay attention to the fact that the closing tag is optional for li, but not optional for ol and ul. 
        In other words, a closing tag is optional for each list item, but not for the list as a whole.
        We must be sure to close the list as a whole! Why? Because if we leave off the closing /ol or /ul, 
        then the browser will not know when our list ends! It will simply treat everything that comes after that point as part of the list.
    </section>
        <P>
        adding type="a" to ol elements to specify that the ordered lists should use lowercase letters instead of the default numerical ordering.
        The type attribute for ol offers several options for list item markers:
        <ul>
            <li>"1" for numbers (the default) 
            <li>"A" for uppercase letters 
            <li>"a" for lowercase letters
            <li>"I" for uppercase Roman numerals
            <li>"i" for lowercase Roman numerals
        </ul>
    <p>
        When you're linking to the top page (or home page) of a site, the URL does not need a file path after the domain name—so you will just see a single slash at the end of the address:
        http://en.wikipedia.org/
        And often this slash will be omitted altogether:
        http://en.wikipedia.org
        This would still be considered a fully-qualified URL.
        In contrast, if we look at the URL for a file on your local system, we must give the file path—in fact, most of the URL is the file path:
        file:///Users/Kelly/notes.html
        If we took away the file path from the above, we would just have:
        file://
        Which is definitely not a fully qualified URL.

    <a href="https://udacity.com"><img src="https://picsum.photos/id/20/600/300" alt="book"></a>
    <p>
        Images significantly enhance the web's appeal, featuring everything from cat pictures to maps and advertisements.
        The img element in HTML, equipped with src (source URL) and alt (text description) attributes enable the inclusion of these visuals in web pages. 
        The alt attribute is crucial for accessibility, describing when images fail to load due to network issues, are missing, or when assisting visually impaired users with screen readers.
        The img element points the browser to an image's location without embedding the file into the HTML document, functioning as an empty element with no closing tag. 
        It integrates directly into the text, influencing layout based on its size.
        This setup underscores the importance of thoughtfully using images in web design to ensure aesthetic appeal and accessibility.
        What about accessibility?
        Alt text is essential for web accessibility, enabling screen readers to describe images to users who are blind or have visual impairments, and ensuring content is accessible when images cannot load or for those using text-based browsers.
        It also supports users with cognitive disabilities and improves SEO by giving search engines context for images.
    <P>
        <strong>Note</strong> target="_blank" to open links in a new tab or window.
        Consider using rel="noopener noreferrer" for security.
        <h4> Block elements</h4>
        Block elements are used for large sections of text, such as paragraphs, headlines, or lists; and also for some other features such as video players and tables.
        A block element creates a (usually invisible) box in the browser display. By default, this box takes up the full width of the display. 
        The beginning of a block always starts on a new line in the display.
        Most block elements have a particular way they are displayed by default: paragraphs have margins around them; lists have bullet-points or numbered items; headlines are printed in large text. There is also a generic block element, div, which has no special defaults.
        p — Paragraph. Text in a paragraph is separated visually from other paragraphs by a small margin.
        ul and ol — Unordered and ordered lists. By default, ul lists are displayed with bullet points, and ol lists with numbered items.
        li — List items inside a ul or ol list. The li element has to be nested inside a ul or ol list; it can't occur on its own.
        Section headers, from h1 (largest) to h6 (smallest). Used for headlines, section titles, and the like.
        div — A logical division of a page or document. Other block elements such as paragraphs, lists, and headers can be nested inside a div.
        You will see the div element much more in the next lesson. Because they don't have any default display settings, divs are heavily used with custom styling with CSS.
        <h4>Inline elements</h4>
        Inline elements do not create a full-width box on the display. They modify the display of text, or insert other things into the text — such as line breaks, images, or hyperlinks.
        em and strong — Emphasis. By default, text inside an em is displayed as italic, and text in strong is displayed as boldface.
        br — Line break. (empty) A line break does not create a new paragraph; it only marks the end of a line.
        sub and sup — Subscript and superscript. Useful for math and chemistry: I have x3+2x2 molecules of H2O.
        mark — Highlighting. Not very often used, but it's kind of cool.
        Some of the inline elements you've seen require attributes, extra information besides the name of the element itself.
        Attributes are written inside the opening tag of the element.
        img — Images. Needs a src attribute with a URL, and an alt attribute with descriptive text.
        a — Hyperlinks. Needs an href attribute with a URL.
        <h4>Image</h4>
        The syntax for the img tag is like this:
        img src="Image URL here" alt="A description of the image"
        The URL of an image may be an absolute URL, such as http://placebear.com/800/600, or it may be a relative URL such as images/wolves.jpg.
        The alt text is used if the image can't be loaded, or if the user can't see images — such as if the user is using a screen reader(opens in a new tab).
        <h4 class="a">Link</h4>
        Hyperlinks allow the user to navigate from one page to another. They are created using the a element.
        The destination of the link is written in an attribute called href; the link text appears as the contents of the a element. Here's an example:
        a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext" target="_blank"
        Wikipedia's "Hypertext" article /a 
   <blockquote style="color: red"><p>
        The title element in HTML is used to define the title of a web page.
        This title is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab and is also used by search engines as the clickable headline for search results.
        The title element defines the title of a web page.
        It is placed within the head section.
        It is important for SEO and accessibility.
        The title should be concise and descriptive.<cite>udacity com</cite></blockquote>
   <article>
     <h4 class="a">Are head and body required?</h4>
    <p>
        In one sense, no, but in another sense, yes.
        The grammar of HTML does not require that you literally write a head or body tag in your HTML code.
        Many web developers do write these. However, if you don't, the browser will attempt to place them into your code itself.
        It needs to put the head element around certain elements that belong there, such as title; and to put the body element around the elements that form the document's body.
        This means that all the head elements must appear first, and the body elements after.
   </article>

            <li>Elements: Elements that provide information about the document, such as title, meta, and link.<br>
            <li>Content Sectioning Elements: Elements that define the structure of the document, such as &lt;header>, &lt;footer>, &lt;section>, &lt;article>, and &lt;nav>.

            <h2 class="a">Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
            two ways to apply style to HTML elements.
            The first way is to use the style attribute to apply style directly to an HTML element.
            The second way is to use the style element along with a ruleset.
            By the way, when styles are applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute, these are called inline styles.
            The idea is that the style is being applied directly in the same line as the HTML element that it is styling.
            (In contrast, when we use the style element, the style is separated—it's not in the same line.)
            The HTML in the workspace below has three paragraphs of text. Add a style attribute (an inline style) to each element to make it a different color.
        <p>
            Cascading and Specificity
            The term "cascading" in Cascading Style Sheets refers to the way that style properties "cascade" down the DOM tree, starting at the top. A style applied to the body element will affect the entire document. A style applied to a lower-level element will affect that element and all its descendants.
            A style applied at a lower level can override a style at a higher level. For instance, if the body has color: red but a paragraph within the body has color: blue, the blue will apply to that paragraph and to any elements inside it:<br>
            <pre>
                <code>
                  &lt;style>
                    body { color: red; }
                    p { color: blue; }
                </style>
            &lt;body>
                &lt;p> This will be blue, not red. &lt;br>
                &lt;em> Same with this. &lt;/em> &lt;/p>
            &lt;/body>
                </code>
            </pre>
        <p>  The CSS unit em is named for the size of the letter "M", and comes from print typography. 
             The HTML element &lt;em> is short for "emphasis".<br>
             They're spelled the same, and often pronounced the same, but they have no other relation between them at all.
